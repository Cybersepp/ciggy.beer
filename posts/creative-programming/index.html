        <h2 id="the-need-for-creation">The need for creation</h2>
<p>Like many others I enjoy creating and building stuff.
It can range from a small video skit sent to a friend to carving out a viking shield.
Usually my small obsessions don&rsquo;t last for too long but nonetheless they come and go periodcally,
fulfilling my need for creation. Being a software developer I of course enjoy programming as well,
the amount of impact <a href="https://youtu.be/DmV49ogMDEI">one good engineer</a> can create is immeasurable and fascinating.</p>
<p>Unfortunately software engineering world can be rough on creativity with over 9000 meetings, scattered obsolete documentation,
overly bloated legacy development process, never-ending jira logging changes, [&hellip;]  and much more.
Coupled with strict deadlines software development can be all over the place and there will be little time for creative thinking.</p>
<p>One could argue on the aforementioned statements and it&rsquo;s completely justified but this post is not about making translation
of business requirements into code fun, it&rsquo;s about:</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m tired of bloated clicka-clicka in backend, what cool artsy shiet I can do with code?&rdquo;</em></p>
<h2 id="creative-coding">Creative coding</h2>
<p>As you might expect there are different ways to interpret the term <em>creative coding</em>.
It&rsquo;s unclear whether we&rsquo;re talking about the creative process, the medium (code) or the output.
To narrow down the scope of this post I will be interpreting creative programming within this
definition <a href="https://www.frontendplanet.com/what-is-creative-developer/">[1]</a>:</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Creative coding is a type of computer programming in which the goal is to create something expressive instead of something functional.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have strict guidelines, goals or acceptance criteria.
It&rsquo;s about exploration and discovery of mostly unexpected results <a href="https://timrodenbroeker.de/what-is-creative-coding/">[2]</a>.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a birds-eye view of what people have creatively coded.</p>
<h2 id="demoscenes">Demoscenes</h2>
<p>Computer art subculture focused on producing EXTREMELY small filesize (and not only!) audiovisual presentations achieved with low-level code.</p>
<figure>
  <img src="/images/himalaya__TBC__1k.gif" alt="Himalaya 1k" /><figcaption>Himalaya 1k</figcaption></figure> 
<p>This .gif is actually a small section of an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjG1lGCwNAM&amp;ab_channel=DemosceneHigh-QualityVideos%28Annikras%29">OVER 10-MINUTE LONG video WITH AUDIO</a> which is ONLY 1024 bytes.
For reference in Java 1024 bytes can be achieved with 128 long datatype variables.</p>
<p>Weird flex but okay, moving on!</p>
<h2 id="live-coding-music">Live coding music</h2>
<p>In 2020, during my 1st semester computer science studies me and my friend made a 2D Python game <em>Bimgus</em> in post-apocalyptic setting for our Programming class.</p>
<figure>
  <img src="/images/bimgus.png" alt="Bimgus" /><figcaption>Bimgus</figcaption></figure> 
<p>Most of the visuals were made in paint :) .
Why not make SFX and music ourselves if we have fallen this low anyway?.. Why not <em>code</em> the music?</p>
<p>Lucky for us I&rsquo;ve found <a href="https://sonic-pi.net/">Sonic PI</a> code-based music creation tool and thus Bimgus soundtracks were born (a few samples):</p>
<ul>
<li>Main game theme <audio controls>
  <source src="/music/main_game_theme.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
  Your browser does not support the audio element.
</audio> </li>
<li>Death sound effect <audio controls>
  <source src="/music/death_sound.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
  Your browser does not support the audio element.
</audio> </li>
<li>Game over theme <audio controls>
  <source src="/music/gameover_theme.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
  Your browser does not support the audio element.
</audio> </li>
</ul>
<p>Ruby-based Sonic-PI let&rsquo;s you write music in real-time, great for novice game-development as well as ultra-gigachad 8-bit/techno/rave coding DJ experience.</p>

      <iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share; fullscreen" loading="eager" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YvsoWehBbec?autoplay=0&amp;controls=1&amp;end=0&amp;loop=0&amp;mute=0&amp;start=0" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" title="YouTube video"></iframe>
    </div>

<h2 id="generative-art">Generative art</h2>
<p>Generative art is a form of art that is created through the use of algorithms and code. Meaning code itself can&rsquo;t predict
the outcome and therefore result is often unique and unpredictable.</p>
<p>Generative art could be achieved with simple vanilla javascript and a bunch of Math.random()
functions coupled with color-filled objects.</p>
<p>(move your cursor or touch your phone screen for slight epilepsy)
<canvas id="generative-art-canvas" style="border:1px solid"> </canvas></p>
<script type="text/javascript" src="../../js/generative.js"></script>
<p>I played around with code from <a href="https://youtu.be/0v4_Dw0K8pw">here</a> to achieve the result above.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a really rewarding experience because it doesn&rsquo;t take much time to start and is a lot of fun to experiment with.</p>
<p>Of course there are multiple .js libraries made for generative art, for example <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/">p5.js</a> with built-in
web editor so you don&rsquo;t even need to download anything to try it out.</p>
<p>From my humble observations I&rsquo;ve noticed the following about generative art real-world applications:</p>
<ul>
<li>It&rsquo;s great for advertisement background posters.</li>
<li>People sell it.</li>
</ul>
<figure>

<h2 id="donut-shaped-c-code">Donut-shaped C code</h2>
<p>This deserves an extra category.</p>
<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
      <iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share; fullscreen" loading="eager" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DEqXNfs_HhY?autoplay=0&amp;controls=1&amp;end=0&amp;loop=0&amp;mute=0&amp;start=0" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" title="YouTube video"></iframe>
    </div>

<h2 id="my-experience">My experience</h2>
<h3 id="ascii-art">ASCII art</h3>
<p>In 2021 my friend reached out to me about ideas for a video intro and outro.
The video was a compilation broken up into various parts and for every part he wanted a special intro clip.
He asked if I could come up with something <em>code-ish</em> for one of the parts of the video and I agreed.</p>
<p>I never really thought about code being used in such artsy endeavours before which made this little task extremely interesting for me.</p>
<p>I decided to go with old-school-like terminal-loading script in Python which printed out ASCII art of the video title.</p>
<p>In the end script produced the following (sped-up ~2x):</p>
<figure>
  <img src="/images/ascii.gif" alt="Python script which prints ASCII art" /><figcaption>Python script which prints ASCII art</figcaption></figure> 
<p>For the outro I accidentally made progress bar to be printed out separately on each line and I liked how it looked visually so I went with it.</p>
<figure>
  <img src="/images/ascii_2.gif" alt="Python script which prints ASCII art" /><figcaption>Python script which prints ASCII art</figcaption></figure> 
<p><em>There are no mistakes, just happy little accidents.</em>
[bob_ross_beating_the_devil_out_of_it.jpg]</p>
<p>ASCII art was generated with this online tool: <a href="https://patorjk.com/software/taag/#p=display&amp;f=Graffiti&amp;t=Type%20Something%20">patorjk.com</a></p>
<h3 id="obscure-websites">Obscure websites</h3>
<p>On one beautiful evening I&rsquo;ve stumbled (I don&rsquo;t remember how, maybe a sticker on the street lamp-post?) upon Estonian electronic/techno/something music website
<a href="https://amfiib.com/index.html">amfiib.com</a> and was fascinated by
the old-school terminal-like design. They had an &ldquo;explore&rdquo; page which listed a few more interesting websites:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://sunk.world/">sunk.world</a> (Portfolio?..)</li>
<li><a href="https://tape.run/">tape.run</a> (I suspect this website is also produced with <a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo.386/">hugo theme</a>)</li>
<li><a href="https://reivkom.ee/">reivkom.ee</a> (Simple rave website made look like a shell script)</li>
<li><a href="https://ajuokse.ee/">ajuokse.ee</a> (Art website)</li>
<li><a href="https://aigar.guru/">aigar.guru</a> (Spiritual enlightenment music, idk o_o)</li>
</ul>
<p>Inspired, I felt the need to take up some internet space with esoteric content myself.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know what exactly I wanted to do but I knew that I wanted to finish it that night. I&rsquo;ve looked up some basic
<a href="https://threejs.org/">three.js</a> tutorials and it was mind-blowing how easily one can create interactive 3D content on the web without prior experience.
A few beers, three.js tutorials
and stolen codesnippet examples later <a href="https://cybersepp.github.io/fever-dream/">this website</a> was born.</p>
<p>It may seem like a 2D world but your browser actually uses a lot more processing power than it should because it&rsquo;s actually 3D!
I just disabled user input.</p>
<p>User controls for navigating around the world is just one line of code away. Really fun.</p>
<h2 id="its-a-real-job">It&rsquo;s a real job?</h2>
<p>There are not many creative programmer job applications out there but you can definitely be one.
Quite a few companies like gucci require custom-made highly interactive websites.
For <a href="https://marmont.gucci.com/">example this gucci website</a> was made with three.js library.</p>
<p>From different salary sources I&rsquo;ve noticed that the closer you are to being an artist the less you make, oh well.</p>
<p>Average salary is lower than the frontend developer roles but it highly depends on the place and project.</p>
