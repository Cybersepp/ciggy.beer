So naturally I went out and asked google for advice on what technology to use for building a website.
I was instantly overwhelmed with the number of options available.</p><h2 id=options>Options</h2><p>After a bit of searching I&rsquo;ve stumbled upon <a href=https://fouryears.eu/2016/05/19/where-could-i-host-my-website/>this article</a>
by Konstantin Tretyakov which answered all of my questions in a very structured and concise way.
If you ever need help deciding what options are the most suitable for building your own future website I highly recommend the aforementioned article.</p><h2 id=end-result>End result</h2><p>I&rsquo;ve decided to go with the static site generators as they are the most suitable option for my needs. Now there are a few to choose from, the most popular ones being
<a href=https://jekyllrb.com/>jekyll</a> and <a href=https://gohugo.io/>hugo</a>.
The first one has been around for a while now, since 2008 and hugo is a bit more fresh, being released in 2013. Now I understood that hugo is more lightweight compared to jekyll but overall they both would work equally well for my website. So hugo it is.</p><p>Now comes the question, where do I host? Turns out that <a href=https://github.com/>github</a> provides free hosting for one website per user.
There we go, all the building blocks are in place. Last thing to do was to make an actual website and hook it up to github pages.
I ended up making two repos in github, one for source code and the other one for static files the source repo generates.
Then link them together using github sumbodules and
bada bing, bada boom - you&rsquo;re done!</p><p>If you&rsquo;re interested in how that looks in detail, check out this <a href=https://youtu.be/LIFvgrRxdt4>video</a>.</p></div></article><hr><div class=post-info><p><svg width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="feather feather-file-text"><path d="M14 2H6A2 2 0 004 4v16a2 2 0 002 2h12a2 2 0 002-2V8z"/><polyline points="14 2 14 8 20 8"/><line x1="16" y1="13" x2="8" y2="13"/><line x1="16" y1="17" x2="8" y2="17"/><polyline points="10 9 9 9 8 9"/></svg>
