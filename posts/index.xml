            <description>Purpose There are many reasons for why one would want a website for personal use. In my case I needed a website that would fulfil the following criteria:

<p>There are many reasons for why one would want a website for personal use.
In my case I needed a website that would fulfil the following criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>Website hosting must be free (because I&rsquo;m poor)</li>
<li>Clean-looking</li>
<li>Add content with ease</li>
<li>Easy to set up</li>
</ul>
<p>The main purpose of this website is to share content and my toughts on various topics for me and my friends.
Besides, I haven&rsquo;t done anything like this before.
So naturally I went out and asked google for advice on what technology to use for building a website.
I was instantly overwhelmed with the number of options available.</p>
<h2 id="options">Options</h2>
<p>After a bit of searching I&rsquo;ve stumbled upon <a href="https://fouryears.eu/2016/05/19/where-could-i-host-my-website/">this article</a>
by Konstantin Tretyakov which answered all of my questions in a very structured and concise way.
If you ever need help deciding what options are the most suitable for building your own future website I highly recommend the aforementioned article.</p>
<h2 id="end-result">End result</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve decided to go with the static site generators as they are the most suitable option for my needs. Now there are a few to choose from, the most popular ones being
<a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">jekyll</a> and <a href="https://gohugo.io/">hugo</a>.
The first one has been around for a while now, since 2008 and hugo is a bit more fresh, being released in 2013. Now I understood that hugo is more lightweight compared to jekyll but overall they both would work equally well for my website. So hugo it is.</p>
<p>Now comes the question, where do I host? Turns out that <a href="https://github.com/">github</a> provides free hosting for one website per user.
There we go, all the building blocks are in place. Last thing to do was to make an actual website and hook it up to github pages.
I ended up making two repos in github, one for source code and the other one for static files the source repo generates.
Then link them together using github sumbodules and
bada bing, bada boom - you&rsquo;re done!</p>

            <description>Short answer: No, not yet. ¯_(ツ)_/¯ [WIP]
Inspired by this: https://github.com/HackingIntoYourHeart/Unoriginal-Rice-Patty
Since the 1990s car manufacturers were pressured into upping their keyfob cybersecurity. The reason behind this was usage of static codes for unlocking the car. This implies that there was one unique code for the car which the keyfob knew.

<p>Since the 1990s car manufacturers were pressured into upping their keyfob cybersecurity.
The reason behind this was usage of static codes for unlocking the car. 
This implies that there was one unique code for the car which the keyfob knew.
When pressing any button on the keyfob the unique code would be sent to the car and 
the car would do the desired action, e.g. unlocking itself. 
The hacker would be able to (relatively) easily record the signal from the keyfob while being in close proximity and gain
unlimited access to your vehicle. This rather unfortunate and sad state of affairs is called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replay_attack">replay attack</a>.</p>
<p>Aforementioned inspiration source claims that Honda was using static codes all this time. Since I own a 2002 second gen Honda CR-V I&rsquo;m going to try the replay attack on my own car.</p>
